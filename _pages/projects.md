Projects:
The first project involved creating a readme file that listed all of our collective degrees + research interests. I was able to utilize Git Bash to navigate Github, and myself and my fellow group mates were able to upload our information, and share our command/codes for how we completed the code. 

And finally, I created this wonderful website! The image took me half an hour to work on and a lot of googling, but this is my first time ever using Git Hub, so I am proud of myself for pushing through and getting that tiny image uploaded! I also included my CV for good measure, and I hope to further populate this website soon!

TLDR: Github is kinda confusing, but I'm getting the hang of it!
